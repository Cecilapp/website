### Features

#### Support of images CDN

You can easily use a CDN to provide images of your site, for example:

```yaml
assets:
  images:
    cdn:
      enabled: true
      # Cloudinary
      url: 'https://res.cloudinary.com/%account%/image/fetch/c_limit,w_%width%,q_%quality%,f_%format%,d_%default%/%image_url%'
      account: 'xxxx'
      # Cloudimage
      url: 'https://%account%.cloudimg.io/%image_url%?w=%width%&q=%quality%&force_format=%format%'
      account: 'xxxx'
```
