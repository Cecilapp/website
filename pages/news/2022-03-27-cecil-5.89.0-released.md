### Features

#### WebP image optimization

[WebP](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp) images can be optimized (compressed) in addition to JPEG, PNG, GIF and SVG formats by enabling the following option in config file:

```yaml
assets:
  images:
    optimize:
      enabled: true
```

It works in templates with the [`asset()` function](/documentation/templates/#asset) and in [pagesâ€™ body](/documentation/content#body) with the image Markdown tag.

### Fixes

- A *Note* must be an `aside` not a `div`

### Misc

- Documentation fixed
