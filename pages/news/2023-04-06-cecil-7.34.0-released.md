```twig
{{ asset(image_path)|lqip }}
```

[Documentation â†’](/documentation/templates/#lqip)

_Example:_

```html
{% set photo_full = asset('/photo.jpeg') %}
{% set photo = photo_full|resize(640) %}
<div style="background-image:url({{ photo|lqip }});background-repeat:no-repeat;background-position:center;background-size:cover;">
  <a href="{{ url(photo_full) }}">{{ photo|html() }}</a>
</div>
```
