This release significantly enhances the asset handling system, especially for audio and video files, and refines the asset API for template usage. The changes include improved extraction and documentation of media metadata, new utility methods for assets, and codebase refactoring for clarity and maintainability.

**Asset Metadata and API Enhancements:**

* Audio and video assets now expose richer metadata: audio assets provide `duration`, `bitrate`, and `channel`, while video assets provide `duration`, `width`, and `height`. These properties are now directly available on asset objects, making them easier to use in templates.
* The asset API is extended with new methods: `dataurl()` for generating a Base64 data URL, `integrity()` for SRI hashes, and improved `fingerprint()` logic. Assets now implement `ArrayAccess`, allowing array-like access to their properties.

**Documentation Updates:**

* The documentation for templates and asset usage is updated to reflect new asset properties and usage examples for audio and video files, as well as new API methods like `dataurl` and `hash`.

**Refactoring and Code Quality:**

* Refactored internal methods for clarity: image optimization logic is renamed (`optimizeImage`), and width/height extraction is unified for images and videos. The code for extracting audio and video metadata is improved for direct property access.
* Improved comments and cache handling for asset processing, and clarified option handling in the asset constructor.
* Increased the cyclomatic complexity threshold in the PHP Mess Detector config to reduce noise from complexity warnings.

**Deprecations and Removals:**

* Removed or refactored legacy or redundant methods, such as the old image optimization and width/height accessors, consolidating functionality and improving maintainability.

**Other Minor Changes:**

* Updated documentation metadata (date, updated fields).

These changes collectively make asset handling more powerful and easier to use, especially for media files, while improving code clarity and maintainability.
