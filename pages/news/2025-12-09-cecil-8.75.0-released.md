This release significantly enhances the asset handling system, especially for audio and video files. The changes include improved extraction and documentation of media metadata, new utility methods for assets, and codebase refactoring for clarity and maintainability.

**Asset Metadata and API Enhancements:**

* Audio and video assets now expose richer metadata: audio assets provide `duration`, `bitrate`, and `channel`, while video assets provide `duration`, `width`, and `height`. These properties are now directly available on asset objects, making them easier to use in templates.

**Documentation Updates:**

* The documentation for templates and asset usage is updated to reflect new asset properties and usage examples for audio and video files.

These changes collectively make asset handling more powerful and easier to use, especially for media files, while improving code clarity and maintainability.
