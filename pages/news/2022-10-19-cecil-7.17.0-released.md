### Features

#### Normalize asset path in Markdown

A static or asset file relative path is automatically normalized.

_Example:_

```markdown
![](../../assets/images/image.jpeg)
```

Become:

```html
<img src="/images/image.jpeg">
```

### Fix

- Fix path to assets cache directory
- Error if wrong relative to parent asset path
