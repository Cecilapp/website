### Features

#### i18n support migrated to Symfony Translation + Twig Intl

[Twig Extensions](https://github.com/Cecilapp/Twig-extensions) have been removed in favor of [Symfony Translation](https://symfony.com/doc/5.4/translation.html) and [Twig Intl Extension](https://github.com/twigphp/intl-extra).

With Symfony Translation _Gettext_ is no more required.

**Breaking changes** about localization:

1. the short _trans_ tag `{% trans "text" %}` is no more supported
2. variables must set between `%%` instead of `{{}}`
3. `localizeddate` filter is replaced by `format_date`
