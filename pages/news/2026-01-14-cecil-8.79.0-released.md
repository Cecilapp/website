This release updates the slugification logic to better handle multilingual content, especially Chinese characters, and refactors related code for improved maintainability. It also adds new test fixtures for French and Chinese blog posts to ensure proper handling of non-ASCII characters.

### Slugification improvements

* Updated the `Page::slugify` method to detect Chinese (Han) characters in the input and apply the Chinese ruleset for slugification when appropriate, improving URL generation for Chinese content.
* Refactored the `Url` class to delegate slugification to `Page::slugify`, removing its own slugifier instance and related logic for consistency and code reuse.
