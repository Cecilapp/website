### Features

#### New `canonical` variable to override the generated canonical URL

If the partial `metatags.html.twig` is included in your main template, a canonical URL is automatically added to the page head. With the `canonical` variable (in page front matter) you can override the canonical URL and the canonical title of each page:

```yaml
canonical:
  url: <URL>
  title: "<URL title>" # optional
```
