### Features

#### New `canonical` variable to override the generated canonical URL

If the partial `metatags.html.twig` is included in your main template, a canonical URL is automatically added to the page `<head>`.  
With the `canonical` variable (set in page [front matter](/documentation/content/#front-matter)) you can override the canonical URL and the canonical title:

```yaml
canonical:
  url: <URL>
  title: "<URL title>" # optional
```
