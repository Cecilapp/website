### Features

#### Variable to override generated canonical URL

If the partial `metatags.html.twig` is included in a template, a canonical link is automatically added to the page head, but you can override through the variable `canonical` in the front matter:

```yaml
canonical:
  url: <URL>
  title: "<URL title>" # optional
```
