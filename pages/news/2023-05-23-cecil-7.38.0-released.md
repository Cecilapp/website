### Breaking change

#### Changes ID of localized pages

The way to define a page ID have been refactored: the language code of a translated page is no more a suffix (`page.code`) and is now a prefix (`code/page`).

Example: `blog/post-1.fr` become `fr/blog/post-1`.

### Fix

- `getIdWithoutLang()` fixed
- Pagination sorting fixed

### Miscs

- `native_function_invocation` rule applied for better performance (e.g.: `\is_array()` instead of `is_array()`)
- Dependencies updated
