### Features

#### Debug output of translations

If _build_ or _server_ command is ran in debug mode (e.g.: `php cecil.phar serve -vvv`) some details about translations are printed :

```bash
Translation loader for format "yaml" found
Translation loader for format "mo" found
Translation file "path/translations/messages.fr.yaml" added
Translation file "path/translations/messages.fr.mo" added
Intl extension is loaded
```

It is useful to know:

  1. what translations loaders are used
  2. what files are added to translations catalog
  3. if the Intl extension is available on the system

### Fixes

- Loads translations even if there is only 1 language configured
- Pagination template (`partials/paginator.html.twig`) fixed

### Misc

- Dependencies updated
- Code enhanced
