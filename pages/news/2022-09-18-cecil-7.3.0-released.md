### Features

#### Support of custom (localized) `path` for section

Sections (i.e.: `section/index.md`) now support custom `path`:

```yaml
path: custom/path/
```

[Documentation →](/documentation/content/#predefined-variables)

The custom `path` of a section can be different by language:

```yaml
paths:
  - section: <section’s name>
    language: <language> # optional
    path: <path of pages, with palceholders>
```

[Documentation →](/documentation/configuration/#paths)
