This release upgrades the project to require PHP 8.2 or higher. It also introduces support for desktop notifications and improves the build and test process. The most important changes are grouped below.

### PHP Version and Dependency Upgrades

The minimum required PHP version is now 8.2 (was 8.1), and support for PHP 8.1 is dropped across all configuration and documentation files, including composer.json, CI/CD workflows, and documentation.  
Symfony and related PHP package dependencies are updated from version 6.4 to 7.4, and other dependencies are also upgraded. New dependency `jolicode/jolinotif` is added, and `performing/twig-components` is bumped to ^0.7.

### Documentation Updates

All documentation, including the README and quick start guides, is updated to require PHP 8.2+.  
The build instructions now include steps for building both PHAR and full packages, and reference the new tools used.

### Feature Additions

Adds a `--notif` option to CLI commands, enabling desktop notifications on build completion and server start.
