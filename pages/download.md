## Install globally

For more comfort you should install Cecil globally.

### macOS

You can install Cecil on macOS with üç∫[Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```bash
brew install cecilapp/tap/cecil
```

### Windows

1. Move `cecil.phar` in a dedicated directory like `C:\bin`
2. Rename it from `cecil.phar` to `cecil`
3. Append `;C:\bin` to your `PATH` environment variable
4. Create a [wrapping batch script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cecilapp/Cecil/master/bin/cecil.bat)

### Linux

```bash
mv cecil.phar /usr/local/bin/cecil
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/cecil
```

### PHIVE

The PHAR Installation and Verification Environment ([PHIVE](https://phar.io)).

```bash
phive install cecil
```

## Update

The easiest way to update Cecil to the last version is to use the dedicated command:

```bash
cecil self-update
```

:::info

- Homebrew: `brew upgrade`

## Get a specific version

If you want to download a specific version you can specify it in the URL path.

```bash
curl -LO https://cecil.app/download/7.55.0/cecil.phar
```
