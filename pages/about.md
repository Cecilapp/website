Cecil is a CLI application, powered by [PHP](https://www.php.net), that merge plain text files (written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)), images and [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com) templates to generate a [static website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page).

The [first version](https://github.com/Cecilapp/Cecil/commit/58cd48bcc72baa7636ffdd0520d26c2847130537) was published in Sep 2013 and was a very simple PHP script powered by `Zend\Console` and Twig.
