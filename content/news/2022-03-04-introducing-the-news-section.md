Since the creation of Cecil the only way to know about new features and other fixes introduced in a new version was the project's [Releases page on GitHub](https://github.com/Cecilapp/Cecil/releases).

Nevertheless, the information communicated remained very technical and not always detailed (unless you put your nose in the code itself).

Also, we have created the **[News section](/news/)** in order to be able to communicate with users more explicitly on:

1. What are the new features of a major version?
2. What bugs are fixed in a minor release?

We hope you like it ðŸ¤µ
