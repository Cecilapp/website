### Features

#### Markdown _Note_ block-level element

A new Markdown element is available: **_Note_**.

It encapsulates a Markdown text (Information, tip, important, etc. What you need) in a `<div>` element with a dedicated CSS class, named by the type of the note, i.e. `class="note note-<type>"`.

```markdown
:::tip
**Tip:** Advice here.
:::
```

Is converted to:

```html
<div class="note note-tip">
  <p>
    <strong>Tip:</strong> Advice here.
  </p>
</div>
```

> In the previous example `tip` is the type of the note.

Examples in the context of this website:

:::tip
**Tip:** This is an advice.
:::

:::info
**Info:** Information note.
:::

:::important
**Important:** Important message.
:::
