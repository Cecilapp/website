### Features

#### Option to disable remote images fetching

Before the 5.90 release, remote (i.e.: external) images used in pages' body (e.g.: `![](https://example.com/image.jpg)`) were fetched and stored locally, in the cache directory.  
However, this is not a behavior that we want to use systematically, that's why we added an option to disable it:

```yaml
body:
  images:
    remote:
      enabled: false
```

:::important
**Important:** If you disable the _remote_ option Cecil can't handle images (no resize, no optimiozation, etc.).

### Fix

- Option to disable auto-genertared favicons in the [metatags](/documentation/configuration/#metatags-configuration) template is now working

### Miscs

- Better commands description/help
